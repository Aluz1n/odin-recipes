            <div><P><h4>This a wonderful base recipe and you can tweak it if need be.
                Definitely use sesame oil, you can “cheat” and buy minced refrigerated in a tube lemon grass, 
                or buy the stalk pill and cut in larger pieces where you can fish them out, lol! Another important 
                is the type of Thai paste you use, Mae Ploy red curry paste is the best and gives you the most authentic flavor. 
                I add garlic chili pepper (in a jar from the Asian section at the grocery store) as we like it rather spicy, 
                I use a variety of seafood, jumbo prawns, I buy the big bag of frozen seafood from Costco to add scallops, 
                calamari, mussels and or the smaller ones from Trader Joe’s. Another thing I do is, in addition to baby Bella 
                mushrooms, I add “seafood mushrooms”, you can find them at any Asian market in the produce area, the look like fat 
                noodles, save a bit on the carbs. Kaffir leaves add also a great authentic lime flavor. Lime zest and juice works 
                well as well! I buy the leaves in the Asian market, they are also available fresh through Amazon. Just wrap them 
                in a damp paper towel, put them in a zip loc bag and keep them in the freezer… they remain bright green and fragrant 
                when handled for a very long time. Just a wonderful all around recipe! Try it as will definitely enjoy it. 
                I make a large pot as my family goes crazy over it.</h4></P></div>
